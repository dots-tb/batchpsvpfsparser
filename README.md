# batchpsvpfsparser
Batch decrypts games from a folder to a temporary folder, copies a specific file to the output folder and deletes the temporary files.
In the release build, the folder is called "games" and the file is called "eboot.bin" but that can easily be modified.

To be used with [psvpfsparser](https://github.com/motoharu-gosuto/psvpfstools).
