To be used with [psvpfsparser](https://github.com/motoharu-gosuto/psvpfstools).

Batch decrypts games from a folder to a temporary folder, copies a specific file to the output folder and deletes the temporary files.

In the release build, the folder is called _"games"_ and the file is called _"eboot.bin"_ but that can easily be modified.
